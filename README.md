# Deep-learning-augmentation-in-ECG-biometric-authentication
Developing a Biometric Authentication using ECG signal with deep learning.
* Preprocessing the ECG Signal to create a database of single, double, and triple beat image.
* Used Base line Drift, and Bandpass filter to remove unwanted signal. 
* Used R-Peak / find_peaks function from the scipy.signal library to find potential peaks in the ecg_signal.
* Designed the Siamese Model to train & validate the training the data and test it.
